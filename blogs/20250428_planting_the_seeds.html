    <h1>Planting the Seeds of Change: The Story Behind TriTree</h1>
    <p><em>April 28, 2025</em></p>

    <p>I met Soe Min during a three-month exchange program in Taiwan. We lived together in the same dorm room, shared meals, made trips to Costco, and spent countless hours exchanging stories and life philosophies. Through those conversations, I found a deep resonance between us — a shared belief that happiness requires hard work, that education has the power to transform lives, and that we each have a responsibility to make a meaningful impact on the world.</p>

    <p>One evening, Soe Min said something that stayed with me: "Research is like cooking. You try the first time, you fail, you adjust your method, and you try again, and again, until you find a 'good' solution — then you write it down for others to learn from."</p>

    <p>I smiled when I heard that — because it perfectly captured the spirit of learning, perseverance, and collaboration that we both believed in.</p>

    <p>When I returned to Vietnam, it felt like something was missing without those late-night talks. But Soe Min and I stayed in touch, still dreaming about how we could create change. And then one day, an idea sparked in my mind:
    <strong>What if we could bring research skills to high school students?</strong></p>

    <p>I believe research can change a generation, a country, even the world. And I believe that true research is never done alone — it is built through collaboration.</p>

    <p>That’s why we founded <strong>TriTree Research Center</strong>.<br>
    Our mission is simple:<br>
    <strong>To introduce research skills to the younger generation, and to change the world through collaboration and education.</strong></p>

    <p>As a Vietnamese saying goes:<br>
    <em>"Một cây làm chẳng nên non, ba cây chụm lại nên hòn núi cao."</em><br>
    (One tree alone cannot form a hill; three trees together can form a mountain.)</p>

    <p>At TriTree, we believe that together, we can move mountains.</p>
